#+TITLE: My Haskell Learning Journey on OpenSUSE

[[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Haskell-Logo.svg/200px-Haskell-Logo.svg.png][Haskell Logo]]

* Introduction

This repository is my personal learning resource for Haskell programming language on OpenSUSE. As I embark on this journey, I will explore the functional paradigm and develop my Haskell skills on the OpenSUSE operating system.

* Prerequisites

Before starting my Haskell learning journey, I need to ensure that my OpenSUSE system is set up correctly with the following prerequisites:

1. **OpenSUSE Operating System**: I have OpenSUSE installed on my machine. For installation instructions, I can visit the [[https://www.opensuse.org/][OpenSUSE website]].

2. **Package Manager**: OpenSUSE uses `zypper` as its default package manager. To keep it up to date, I can run the following command:

#+begin_src sh
sudo zypper refresh
#+end_src

3. **GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler)**: GHC is the primary compiler for Haskell. I have already installed GHC using `zypper`:

#+begin_src sh
sudo zypper install ghc
#+end_src

4. **Cabals**: Cabal is a package manager for Haskell. I have installed it using `zypper`:

#+begin_src sh
sudo zypper install cabal-install
#+end_src

* Getting Started

To begin my Haskell learning journey, I'll follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: I have already cloned the repository to my local machine:

#+begin_src sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/haskell-learning-opensuse.git
cd haskell-learning-opensuse
#+end_src

2. **Haskell Setup**: I have set up my Haskell environment by installing the required dependencies using Cabal:

#+begin_src sh
cabal update
cabal install --only-dependencies
#+end_src

3. **Editor**: I use my preferred code editors, which is Emacs and VsCode, to write Haskell code.

* Learning Resources

Throughout my Haskell learning journey, I will utilize the following resources:

1. **Official Haskell Website**: I'll visit the [[https://www.haskell.org/][Haskell official website]] for documentation, tutorials, and guides.

2. **Haskell Wikibook**: The [[https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell][Haskell Wikibook]] offers comprehensive tutorials and explanations for beginners.

3. **Learn You a Haskell for Great Good**: I'll read the online book "[[http://learnyouahaskell.com/][Learn You a Haskell for Great Good]]" to grasp the fundamentals.

4. **Haskell Reddit Community**: I might join the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/][Haskell subreddit]] to ask questions and engage with the Haskell community.

* Personal Notes and Progress

Here, I will keep track of my personal notes, progress, and any specific resources I find helpful during my Haskell learning journey:
